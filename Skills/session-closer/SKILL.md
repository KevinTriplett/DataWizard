# Session Closer Skill

## Overview

Writes the session log entry at the end of every work session. The session log entry is the primary handoff mechanism — the next instance reads it during orientation and picks up where this session left off. There is no separate handoff briefing. The session log IS the handoff.

## When to Use

- End of any session (user says "let's wrap up," "close out," "write the session log," "we're done")
- At a natural break point when the user wants to capture progress before continuing
- If you notice the session has done significant work and no log entry has been written yet

### When NOT to Use

- Mid-session status updates (just talk in chat)
- Updating action items only (do that as part of closing, or separately)

## How to Close a Session

### Step 1: Review the session

Scan the conversation for:
- What was accomplished (files created, modified, moved, decisions made)
- What was discussed but not yet acted on
- Any problems encountered and how they were resolved
- Patterns discovered, assumptions confirmed or invalidated, tool behaviors learned

### Step 2: Draft the session log entry

Follow the output format below. Write the full entry and present it in chat for user approval.

### Step 3: Get approval and write

Present the draft. The user may want to edit, add context, or adjust priorities. Once approved:
1. Re-read the session log shell to get the current section number and embed list
2. Write the new section file to the session log folder
3. Patch the shell to add the embed reference for the new section

### Step 4: Update related infrastructure files

Check whether the session produced work that belongs in other files:
- **Action items**: Check off completed items, add new ones. Optional but recommended.
- **Decision log**: If decisions were made during the session (agreements, vision refinements, commitments, technical choices, scope changes), they belong as separate entries in the Decision Log. Note them in "What happened" and point to the Decision Log entry.
- **Harvest log**: If harvesting was done during the session, update the Harvest Log with what was harvested, from which sources, and into which project notes.

Propose specific changes for each file. Get approval before writing.

## Output Format

The entry is a section file in the session log folder (e.g., `0.2 Session Log - Project/13.0 Session 29 - Brief Title.md`).

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
title: "Session N - Brief Descriptive Title"
type: project-doc
parent: "[[0.2 Session Log - Project]]"
section: N
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
datawizard_protocol_version: "1.7"
```

**Content structure:**

```markdown
*Part of the [[0.2 Session Log - Project]]*

## Session N: YYYY-MM-DD (Brief Title)

### What happened

[Narrative of what was accomplished. Dense but readable. Group related work
under bold topic headers. Include file paths for anything created or modified.]

**Files created:** [list with full paths]
**Files updated:** [list with full paths]
**Files archived/moved:** [list if applicable]
**Status:** complete | in progress — [what's pending]

### Learnings

- **category**: Description of the learning with enough context that a future
  instance searching for this topic would find it useful. Reference the source
  (decision, tool, research, conversation) that produced the insight.

Categories: pattern-confirmed, pattern-discovered, tool-behavior,
decision-validated, assumption-invalidated, edge-case

If no learnings this session, write: "No new learnings this session."

### What's next (Session N+1)

[Write this as if briefing a new team member who has read the 0.0 but nothing
else. This section is the handoff — it must be specific enough that the next
instance can start working immediately.]

Include:
- **Specific file paths** to read first (not just topic names)
- **Why this work matters** — one sentence connecting to the larger arc
- **What depends on what** — sequence and causal chain
- **Prioritization** — what's the main focus vs side tasks
- **Key documents** — list the 3-5 most important files for the next instance
  to read, with a phrase explaining what each contains

Adapt detail to the work type:
- Research/harvest: what sources, what to extract, where output goes
- Build/migration: what spec to follow, what success looks like
- Design: what prior decisions constrain the space, what the deliverable is
- Debugging: what's broken, what was tried, where the evidence is
```

## Writing the Title

The session title should capture the main theme in 3-8 words. Use plain hyphens, not em-dashes. Good titles: "Session Closer Skill, Reddit Triage". Bad titles: "Various tasks and cleanup" (too vague).

## Common Mistakes

- **Vague "What's next."** "Continue the skills work" is useless. "Build the session-closer skill — read Section 6 Proposal #1 and Section 7 Proposal #11 in the Agent Architecture doc for the spec" is useful.
- **Missing file paths in "What's next."** Every "What's next" should have at least 2-3 exact paths. The incoming instance shouldn't need to search for anything.
- **No prioritization.** Without it, the next instance treats everything as equal priority. Use "Priority 1 / Priority 2" or "The main focus is X. Also when you get a chance: Y."
- **Learnings too vague.** "Learned about MCP tools" isn't searchable. "tool_search needs multi-word descriptive queries including the tool name; single words return nothing" is.
- **Forgetting the "why."** A fresh instance doesn't know why a particular task matters. One sentence of framing prevents misunderstanding.
- **Over-narrating "What happened."** This isn't a diary. Dense, scannable, focused on what a future reader needs to know.

## Relationship to Other Files

- **Session log shell** (`0.2 Session Log - Project.md`): Add an embed reference (`![[section filename]]`) to the shell after creating the section file.
- **Action items**: Check off completed items, add new ones. Optional but recommended.
- **Decision log**: Decisions belong as separate numbered entries. The session log references them but doesn't replace them.
- **Harvest log**: Harvesting work gets its own log entry with source, output, and status.
